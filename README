ZBridgeE will, when it is finished, be a program for bridge players who wants to play
bridge with the help of a computer. There can be from 0 to 4 human players. The
computer(s) plays the missing players. Players can be either local on the local
computer or remote on one or more remote computers. I started development of the
program because I was not satisfied with the (to my knowledge) existing
bridge programs with regard to their net abilities. ZBridgeE is for embedded
computers (currently only Android). Its companion ZBridge is for Windows computers.


Development environment is Qt with the use of Qt Creator as IDE.

Installation for ZBridge development:

1. Install smartgit (I do not use Qt Creators GIT functionality).
	Clone ZBridgeE to c:/projects/qt/zbridgeE
	
2. Install eclipse (I use eclipse for using yakindu and UMLet).
	Install yakindu in eclipse.
	Install UMLet in eclipse.
	Import project ZBridgeE to eclipse without copy (default)
	
3. Install Qt (at least v. 5)

4. Install DoxyGen
		Install Graphviz
		Install mscgen
		Set dot and mscgen pathes in DoxyFile
                
5. Install MSVC.
