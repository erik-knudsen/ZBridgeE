ZBridgeE is a program for bridge players who wants to play
bridge with the help of a computer. There can be from 0 to 4 human players. The
computer(s) plays the non human players. Players can be either local on the local
computer or remote on one or more remote computers. I started development of the
program because I was not satisfied with the (to my knowledge) existing
bridge programs with regard to their net abilities.
ZBridgeE is for embedded computers (currently only Android). Its companion ZBridge
is for Windows computers. They use the same communication protocol i.e. they can
play bridge with each other on the internet. 
Yakindu is used for modelling the states of the communication protocol.
Bridge bidding is implemented by means of a table. Bo Haglunds Double Dummy Solver
is used for calculating the best card to play.

The ZBridgeE software is covered by the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version3 (GPLv3).


Development environment is Qt with the use of Qt Creator as IDE.

Installation for ZBridge development:

1. Install smartgit (I do not use Qt Creators GIT functionality).
	Clone ZBridgeE to c:/projects/qt/zbridgeE
	
2. Install eclipse (I use eclipse for using yakindu and UMLet).
	Install yakindu in eclipse.
	Install UMLet in eclipse.
	Import project ZBridgeE to eclipse without copy (default)
	
3. Install Qt (at least v. 5)

4. Install DoxyGen
		Install Graphviz
		Install mscgen
		Set dot and mscgen pathes in DoxyFile
                
5. For Android see the "Getting Started with Qt for Android" in the 
   Qt documentation. The Android SDK Tools, The Android NDK and JAVA SE Development
   kits are needed. There is also some updating and configuration to
   be performed.
   The Double Dummy Solver by Bo Haglund is statically linked. Makefile_linux
   is used to generate libdds.a.
                
6. For Windows.
   Install Visual Studio Community 2015. Start Visual Studio and create a
   new c++ project and install required parts.
   The Double Dummy Solver by Bo Haglund is generated as a dll. Makefile_Visual
   is used to generate .lib and .dll files. The .lib file is for the linker
   and the .dll file is for the executable.
   You cannot use the MinGW C++ compiler, which can be installed as a part 
   of Qt. Only the Visual Studio C++ compiler has support for the Qt webview
   module. This module is used for ZBridgeE help.
