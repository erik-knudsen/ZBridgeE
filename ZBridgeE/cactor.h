 * \brief This abstract class implements the declaration of the generic strategy
 * for actor classes (local and remote - not auto).
 *
 * Actor strategy classes have a common method interface. The interface is
 * defined partly by means of the virtual methods in this class. And partly by means of
 * methods, which are common for all actor managers (Local and Remote). These
 * methods are implemented in this class.
