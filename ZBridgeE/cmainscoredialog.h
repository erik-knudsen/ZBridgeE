/**
 * @brief The CMainScoreDialog class shows a table with results of games played untill now by the user.
 *
 * The table has one line for each played game (board). The content of the table depends on
 * the type of play (scoring method). The first 4 columns are common for all scoring methods. They show
 * board number, vulnerability, contract and tricks. If the user clicks a row then the game (auction and play)
 * is shown in a separate dialog. The remaining columns in the table depends on the scoring method:\n
 *   - Practice has a 1 additional column which shows the duplicate score for the game.
 *   - IMP (International Match Point) and MP (Match Point) has 3 additional columns which shows duplicate score,
 *     IMP or MP and IMP average or MP average  for games played untill now. Clicking the IMP/MP column for a game
 *     shows in a separate dialog how the game  has been played by other players. Clicking the IMP/MP average
 *     column for a game shows in a separate dialog how the ranking is for all players for games played until now.
 *   - Rubber has 2 additional columns which shows NS below the line points and EW below the line points.
 *     Below the line points are shown red if vulnerable and green for a won rubber. Clicking one of the 2
 *     additional columns for a game shows in a separate dialog a rubber score table for the current rubber.
