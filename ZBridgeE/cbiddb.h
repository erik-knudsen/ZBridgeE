/**
 * @brief This class is the top level class of the bid database.
 *
 * The intention of the database is, based on definition of selected conventions, the given hand
 * (13 cards) and the auction (bidding sequence) till now, to identify the best next bid.
 *
 * The database has three levels:
 *   - The first level (page) selects a top level of rules, based on selected conventions. The first
 *     level is a one to one mapping (injective).
 *   - The second level (auction) delimits the rules in the top level set, to rules relevant for
 *     a given auction (bidding sequence). The second level is also a one to one mapping.
 *   - The third level (next bid) further delimits the rules to one rule based on the hand (13 card) features
 *     (High card points etc.) and in some cases also to selected conventions. The selected rule
 *     identifies the next bid. The third level is a one to many mapping (the next bid can be selected
 *     by more than one rule).
 *     In some cases the third level instead identifies a substitute auction (sequence of bids).
 *     It might also happen that the database cannot find a best next bid.
