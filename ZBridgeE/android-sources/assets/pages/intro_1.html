<br>


<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is Bridge and why should I want to
play Bridge?</span></h3>

<p><big>Bridge is a card game played with four people.  It is an intricate and
complex card game and involves many elements of planning, communication, and
logical deduction. </big></p>
<br>


<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">How do I play Bridge?</span></h3>

<p><big>It is not an easy game to learn.  Simply watching a group of people
playing the game will not be of much help.  The best way to learn the game is
to start from the bottom, learning the rules and trying out practice games. 
That's where a computer program like this one can be helpful.<br>
<br>
You can find complete instructions on how to play Bridge in the section <a
href="rules.html">About Bridge</a>. </big></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">I already know Bridge, so let&rsquo;s just
