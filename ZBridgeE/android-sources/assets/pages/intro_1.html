<p><big>Welcome
to ZBridge&nbsp; for Windows.&nbsp; ZBridge is an easy-to-use
program
you can use to learn and practice the game of Bridge.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Just what
exactly is Bridge?</span></h3>
<p><big>Bridge
is a card game played with four people.&nbsp; It combines the
elements
of planning, communication, memory, and logical deduction into a
compelling game of skill.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should I
want to play Bridge?</span></h3>
<p><big>Well,
Bridge is probably the most intricate and complex of all card games, or
any games for that matter.&nbsp; In fact, only chess rivals Bridge
for
depth of play and subtlety. </big></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">How do I play
Bridge?</span></h3>
<p><big>As
great as Bridge is, it is not an easy game to learn.&nbsp; Simply
watching a group of people playing the game will not help you learn,
but will most likely end up confusing you.&nbsp; The best way to
get
into the game is to start from the bottom, learning the rules and
trying out practice games.&nbsp; That's where a computer program
like
this one can be helpful.<br>
<br>
You can find complete instructions on how to play Bridge in the section
<a href="rules.html">About Bridge</a>.
