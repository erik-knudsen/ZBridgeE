<p><big>Bridge is a game played by four people in two teams.  The players sit
around a table with the partners sitting across the table facing each other. 
The four player positions are assigned the compass positions of North, East,
South, and West.  The designations are usually relative to each observer; i.e.,
from your point as a player you would usually consider yourself South, looking
across at your partner in the North position.<br>
<br>
Each hand of Bridge consists of two stages, Bidding and Card Play.  The bidding
stage (also called the auction) occurs first, followed by the card play.  One
or more hands are played in a single game, and two or more games are played in
a match.</big></p>
