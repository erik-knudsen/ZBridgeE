<p><big>Bridge
is a game played by four people divided into two teams.&nbsp; The
players sit around a table with the teammates (also called partners)
sitting across the table facing each other.&nbsp; The four player
positions are assigned the compass positions of North, East, South, and
West.&nbsp; Note that the designations are usually relative to each
observer; i.e., from your vantage point as a player you would usually
consider yourself South, looking across at your partner in the North
position.<br>
<br>
Each hand of Bridge consists of two stages, Bidding
and Card Play.&nbsp; The bidding stage (also called the auction)
occurs
first, followed by the card play.&nbsp; One or more hands are
played in
a single game, and two or three games are played in a match, called a
rubber.</big></p><br>
