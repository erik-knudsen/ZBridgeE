<h3><span lang="EN-US"></span></h3>
<p><big>If you already know the game of Bridge, here are
the minimum
instructions necessary to get you started playing ZBridge.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Playing
a
Practice Hand.</span></h3>
<p><big>When
you start ZBridge the first time, you are&nbsp;in Practice
Mode.&nbsp;
You can&nbsp;select &#8220;New Session&#8221; from the toolbar
to
deal a new hand, and you will automatically be taken through the
bidding and card play stages. See&nbsp;<a href="mainwindow.html">Mainwindow</a>.
Then upon completion of card
play,
your&nbsp;<a href="scoredialogs.html">scoring</a>
will be shown and a new hand will be dealt.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Playing
a
Rubber.</span></h3>
<p><big>If
you want to play a rubber match, you must select <a href="options.html">Options</a> from the menu
and then <a href="options.html#C5">Game</a> to show
the <a href="gameoptionsdialog.html">Game</a>
dialog. In the Game dialog you select
the&nbsp;<a href="gameoptionsdialog.html#C2">Scoring</a>
tab and then "Rubber Bridge".&nbsp;This will start a
scored rubber match.&nbsp; Hands will be dealt and played until one
side wins the rubber, at which point the total score will be shown and a new scored 
rubber match started.<br>
You can check the rubber score
at any time by selecting&nbsp;<a href="view.html#C2">Score</a> from the menu.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Playing
Against
the Computer.</span></h3>
<p><big>The
score dialog mentioned above in "Playing a Rubber" has two more <a href="gameoptionsdialog.html#C2">choices</a>
you can select if you want to compare your play with what the computer
would do. One is with International Match Point (IMP) scoring and the
other is with Match Point (MP) scoring. At the end of the play the
scoretable shows your play against how the computer would play the
cards.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Playing
Against
Preplayed Games.</span></h3>
<p><big>On
the internet you can find many preplayed bridge games. They are
normally stored in the standard PBN format. With ZBridge you can
play&nbsp;games from a PBN file and compare your results with the
corresponding results in the PBN file. You open the file using the <a href="file.html#C1">Open</a>
entry in the File menu. The game mode depends on the
number of results in the PBN files.

<br>
<p><big>At the end of the play the
<a href="scoredialogs.html">scoretable</a> shows
your play against the alredy played games in the PBN
file.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C5"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Re-Deal
/
Re-Bid / Re-Play.</span></h3>
<p><big>You
can always deal a new hand by selecting "Deal New Hand", regardless of which mode you
are in.&nbsp; You can also return to the start of bidding with the
current hand by selecting "ReBid".&nbsp; In addition, selecting "RePlay" will
return
you to the start of card play (i.e., just before the first trick).
These <a href="game.html">choices</a> can be
selected from the menu.<br>
