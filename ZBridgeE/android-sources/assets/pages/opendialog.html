<p><big>With the Open Dialog you can open and play bridge
plays stored in the PBN format. The PBN format is a standard format for
bridge plays. ZBridge uses this format for storing bridge plays.
ZBridge understands most of the PBN format. So you can play not only
bridge plays stored by ZBridge, but also plays stored by other bridge
programs if only they are in the PBN format. You can also save
partially
played games and later open and play from where you left.&nbsp;</big></p>

<p><big>The dialog is straight forward. You choose the file you want to play and open it.<br> Select "L" to start with a directory location where persistent application data is stored. This is an application-specific directory.<br>
Select "G" to start with a path for data shared with other applications (this includes f.ex. the download location).</big></p>
