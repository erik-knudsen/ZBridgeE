Elements.</font></b></span></h1>
<p><big>Bridge
scoring consists of nine elements. Not all elements are included in all
game variants and the method of accumulation of the elements over
several deals varies.</big></p>
<p><big>If the <span class="mw-redirect">contract</span>
is made, the score for each such deal consists of:</big></p>
<ul>
<li><big>Contract points, assigned to each <span class="mw-redirect">odd trick</span> bid and made</big></li>
<li><big>Overtrick points, assigned for each trick taken
over the contracted number of odd tricks</big></li>
<li><big>A slam bonus for a small slam or grand slam
contract bid and made</big></li>
<li><big>A
bonus, colloquially known as 'for insult', is received at the end of
any deal in which a doubled or redoubled contract is bid and made</big></li>
</ul>
<p><big>If the contract is defeated, the defenders receive</big></p>
<ul>
<li><big>Penalty points, assigned for every <span class="mw-redirect">undertrick</span></big></li>
</ul>
<p><big>In rubber bridge only,</big></p>
<ul>
<li><big>A
rubber bonus is received at the end of a completed rubber by the side
that is first to win two games. A rubber bonus is also awarded for some
game and part-game scores at the end of an unfinished rubber</big></li>
<li><big>An honor bonus is received by any player at the
end of any deal in which he held particular honor cards.</big></li>
</ul>
<p><big>In duplicate bridge only,</big></p>
<ul>
<li><big>A partial-game bonus is received at the end of
each deal for any partial game contract bid and made.</big></li>
<li><big>A game bonus is received at the end of each deal
for any game contract bid and made.</big></li>

<p><big>Contract
points are awarded for each odd trick bid and made. Their values depend
on the suit (or notrump) and whether the contract is doubled or
redoubled; they are not affected by <span class="mw-redirect">vulnerability</span>.
Tricks won beyond that necessary to fulfill the contract are referred
to as overtricks and their scoring points are accounted for separately
because their values are dependent upon declarer's vulnerability.</big></p>

<p><big>When
declarer makes overtricks, their score value depends upon the contract

is undoubled, doubled or redoubled. In an undoubled contract each
overtrick earns the same as in contract points (30 for notrump and
major suit contracts, 20 for minor suit contracts); values increase
significantly when the contract has been doubled or redoubled,
especially when vulnerable.</big></p>

<p><big>Without
a double or redouble, every undertrick has a fixed cost of 100 or 50
points. The scores for (re)doubled undertricks are such that after the
first vulnerable undertrick, <i>n</i> vulnerable
undertricks cost the same as <i>n+1</i>
undertricks when not vulnerable; for example, four undertricks when
doubled and not vulnerable cost 800 points (100+200+200+300), the same
as three undertricks when doubled and vulnerable (200+300+300).</big></p>

<ol>
<li><big>Each deal is scored as in rubber bridge but with

<li><big>The result of each deal by each partnership is

<p><big>In
duplicate scoring, the score for each deal is independent from all
others and is a single number resulting from the addition of points
awarded in accordance with either of two cases:</big></p>
<ul>
<li><big>when the
contract is successful, the declaring side receives a positive score
which is the sum of the following elements, if applicable: (i) contract
points, (ii) overtrick points, (iii) a part-game or game bonus, (iv) a
bonus for making any doubled or redoubled contract, i.e. for 'insult',
and (v) a slam or grand slam bonus; the defending side receives a
negative score of the same absolute value.</big></li>
<li><big>when the contract is
defeated, the defending side receives a positive score based upon the
number of tricks defeated, declarer's vulnerability, and whether
undoubled, doubled or redoubled; the declaring side receives a negative
score of the same absolute value.</big></li>
</ul>
<p><big>In
duplicate bridge, the dealer and the status of vulnerability for each
side is predetermined by the board, there being sixteen possible
combinations.</big></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Matchpoint_scoring">Matchpoint
scoring.</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket"></span><span class="mw-editsection-bracket"></span></span></h3>
<p><big>The most common form of pairs scoring is by
matchpoints. On each board,
a partnership scores two matchpoints for each other partnership that
scored fewer points with the same cards, and one point for each other
partnership that scored the same number of points. Thus, every board is
weighted equally, with the best result earning 100 percent of the
matchpoints available, and the worst earning no matchpoints; the
opponents receive the complement score, e.g. an 80% score for a N-S
pair implies a 20% score for their E-W opponents. Colloquially, a
maximum matchpoints score on a board is known as a "top", and a zero
score is a "bottom". The terms "high board" and "low board" are also
used.</big></p>
<dl>
<dd><big><b>Note 1:</b>
using American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) methods, scoring is one
point for each pair beaten, and one-half point for each pair tied.</big></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><big><b>Note 2:</b> The rule of two
matchpoints for each pair beaten is easy to apply in practice: if the
board is played <i>n</i> times, the top result achieves 2<i>n</i>&#8722;2
matchpoints, the next 2<i>n</i>&#8722;4,
down to zero. When there are several identical results, they receive
the average. However, complications occur if not every board is played
the same number of times, or when an "adjusted" (director-awarded)
score occurs. These cases can result in non-integer matchpoint scores &#8211;
seeNeuberg formula. </big></dd>
</dl>
<p><big>These matchpoints are added across
all the hands that a pair plays to determine the winner. Scores are
usually given as percentages of a theoretical maximum: 100% would mean
that the partnership achieved the best score on every single hand. In
practice, a result of 60% or 65% is likely to win the tournament or
come close. In a Mitchell movement (see above) the overall scores are
usually compared separately for North-South pairs and for East-West
pairs, so that there is one winner in each group (unless
arrow-switching has been applied - see above).</big></p>
<p><big>Historical Note:
At some time in the past, both North-South and East-West might be
awarded the same matchpoint score. Using this arrangement, the lowest
East-West Score would be the winner.</big></p>
<p><big>In Board-a-match team game,
the matchpoints are calculated using a similar principle. Since there
are only two teams involved, the only possible results are 2 (won), 1
(tied) and 0 (lost) points per board.</big></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="International_Match_Point_scoring">International Match
Point scoring.</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket"></span><span class="mw-editsection-bracket"></span></span></h3>
<p><big>In
International Match Point (IMP) scoring, every individual score is
subtracted from another score, and the difference is converted to IMPs,
using the standard IMP table below.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>The
purpose of the IMP table, which has <span class="mw-redirect">sublinear</span>
dependency on differences, is to reduce results occurring from huge
score differences ("swings").</big></p>
<p><big>The score that is being compared against can be
obtained in the following ways:</big></p>
<ul>
<li><big>In team events, it is the score from the other
table;</big></li>
<li><big>In pair events, it can be: </big>
<ul>
<li><big>The <b>datum</b>
score, most often calculated as the average score on board, excluding a
number of top and bottom results. Sometimes, the median score is used
instead.</big></li>
<li><big>In "cross-imps" or "Calcutta" scoring, every
score on board is compared against <b>every other score</b>
(sometimes excluding top and bottom results) and IMPs summed up (and
possibly averaged, to reduce "inflation").</big></li>
<li><big><b>Example of averaged cross-imp
scoring</b>:
Assume that you are one of five pairs who play Board 2 as N/S (you are
vulnerable). On this board you bid and make 4 Spades, scoring +620,
while the other four N/S pairs score &#8722;100, &#8722;100, &#8722;300, and +650. To
figure out your averaged cross-imp score, you would create a table like
the Cross-IMP <i>example table</i> below: after writing in
the scores
of you and your opponents in the bolded areas, you would then fill in
the Score Delta row by subtracting each of the opponent's scores from
yours. Then, you would fill in the IMPS Gained row by converting each
of the score deltas into IMPS via the standard <b>IMP table</b>
(e.g.
720 equates to 12 IMPs, because it falls in the range of 600 to 740 in
the IMP table). You then add up those numbers and get 36 IMPS. To turn
the 36 IMPS into a <b>averaged</b> cross-IMP score, you
simply divide
that number by the number of competitors (36 IMPs divided by 4
competitors) to arrive at 9 as your averaged cross-IMP score.</big></li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_scoring_changes">Recent scoring changes.</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket"></span><span class="mw-editsection-bracket"></span></span></h2>
<p><big>As of 1987, World Bridge Federation
imposed the following scoring changes for duplicate bridge, and as of
1993 also for rubber bridge (however, since there are no official
competitions, rubber bridge players accept them as they see fit):</big></p>
<ul>
<li><big>The
undertrick penalty when doubled, not vulnerable, used to be 100 for the
first undertrick and 200 for each subsequent. This was changed because
it was too easy to sacrifice against a grand slam. A vulnerable grand
slam is worth 1500 (slam bonus) + 500 (game bonus) + 210 (major suit
trick score) = 2210. Down 11, doubled not vulnerable, used to be 2100,
a profitable sacrifice. Under the current scoring rules, down eight
(&#8722;2000) would still show a profit, but down nine (&#8722;2300) would not.</big></li>
</ul>
<p><big>Since
a vulnerable small slam bid and made is worth between 1370 (6 of a
minor) and 1440 (6 notrump), this change also means that for a
non-vulnerable sacrifice, a result of down five (&#8722;1100) would show a
profit, down six (&#8722;1400) might be a small loss or a small gain, and
down seven (&#8722;1700) would be a loss. Under the old scoring rules, down
seven (&#8722;1300) would have been a gain, down eight (&#8722;1500) would have
been a loss.</big></p>
<ul>
<li><big>Also, the "insult bonus" for making a redoubled
contract used to be only 50. This was changed to 100, so that playing 5
of a minor, redoubled, making an overtrick, is always worth more than
an undoubled small slam.</big></li>
</ul>
