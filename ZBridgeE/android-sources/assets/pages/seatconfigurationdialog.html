<p><big>Seats can be configured as either "Auto" or
"Manual". "Auto" means the seat is played by the computer or is remote
and "Manual" means the player is the user. In case "Manual" is chosen
then also the name of the player can be given.</big></p>
<p><big>The "Role" of the computer must also be given here.
You
have three choices:</big></p>
<ul>
<li><big>Server.<br>
The computer acts as a server on the internet. In this case also the
name of the computer and a port must be given. The computer uses two
ports. The port given and the next port. When the computer is server up
to four remote clients can be connected. Each client has the role of
one player. Players that are not remote are handled by the server.<br>
</big></li>
<li><big>Client.<br>
The computer acts as a client on the internet. Here the name of the
host computer (server) must be given and also the port to use. The
computer does also here use two ports. The port given and the next
port. The client has the role of one player. The client is started by selecting <a href="menus.html#C1"><img style="width: 16px; height:15px" alt="New Session" src="images/ManualDefend.bmp"></a> from the clients toolbar. Then when a new session is started by the server, the client will automatically be connected and participate in the play.<br>
</big></li>
<li><big>Standalone.<br>
The computer is standalone and all players are handled by the computer.<br>
