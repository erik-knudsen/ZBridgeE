<h1><span lang="EN-US"><b>Bidding.</b></span></h1>

<h3 id="C1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bidding Terms.</span></h3>

<p><big>The hand starts by dealing thirteen cards face down to each player. 
After looking at their cards, each player bids in turn clockwise around the
table, starting with the dealer.  A bid is a declaration of how many tricks the
player thinks his team can win.  <br>
<br>
A bid is defined as the number of excess tricks over six. Hence, a bid of one
means the team expects to win six tricks plus one, or seven total.<br>
<br>
The range of bids therefore lies from one to seven.  A contract at the 6 or 7
level is called a slam.  A 6-level contract is a small slam, and a 7-level
contract is a grand slam.<br>
<br>
Each bid consists of the bid level plus a trump suit choice.  The trump suit is
the one intended to be supreme for that hand.  That is, when a card of a trump
suit is played, it beats all cards of all other suits, plus any other trump
suit cards lower in rank (with Ace being high).  Also, a bid can specify
&ldquo;no trump&rdquo;, indicating that no suit is chosen as trump.<br>
<br>
Bridge also ranks the suits.  Spades is the highest suit, followed by Hearts,
Diamonds, and Clubs.  In addition, No Trump, while technically not a suit,
ranks above Spades for bidding purposes. Therefore, a bid of 1NT is higher than
1 Spades, which is higher than 1 Hearts, and so on.<br>
<br>
The lower ranking Club and Diamond suits are known as the minor suits, while
the higher ranking Heart and Spade suits are known as the major suits.  <br>
</big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting the Bidding.</span></h3>

<p><big>At the beginning of the hand, the dealer begins (or opens) the
bidding.  And as the bidding proceeds around the table, each player must either
make a bid higher than the previous one, pass, or double the opponent&rsquo;s
bid.<br>
<br>
A double is actually not a bid that&rsquo;s twice as high, but rather a
challenge to the opponents effectively stating &ldquo;I do not think you can
make the contract&rdquo;.  A doubled bid can also be redoubled by the declaring
team, meaning &ldquo;Oh yes, we can make the contract.&rdquo;  Doubling and
redoubling can affect the score as described later.<br>
<br>
During the bidding stage, the main problem facing the players is that they can
only see their own cards.  They cannot see the cards held by their partners,
much less those of their opponents.  So the bidding is largely a boasting game
based on deductive reasoning and educated guesses (and to some extent, coded
signals).<br>
<br>
After one or more bids have been made and three players in a row pass, the
final bid becomes the contract which the bidding team has to fulfill during the
card play stage.  The bidding team gets points if they win at least the number
of tricks claimed in their bid, and if they fail, the defending team gets
points.  <br>
<br>
At this point, the game becomes a contest to see whether the declaring team can
win sufficient tricks to make the contract, or whether the defending team can
keep them from doing so. </big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes.</span></h3>
<big>If all four players pass on their first turn, the hand is said to be
passed out, and a new hand is dealt.<br>
Each time a new hand is dealt, the deal shifts to the next player clockwise
around the table.</big><br>
