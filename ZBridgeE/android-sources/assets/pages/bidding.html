Terms.</span></h3>
<p><big>The
hand starts by dealing thirteen cards face down to each
player.&nbsp;
After looking at their cards, each player bids in turn clockwise around
the table, starting with the dealer.&nbsp; A bid is a declaration
of
how many tricks (rounds of card play) the player thinks his team can
win. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In the language of bridge, a bid is defined as the
number of excess tricks over six.&nbsp; This is because there are
13
cards in each hand, and hence 13 rounds or tricks; therefore the
bidding team is claiming that it can win at least half of the tricks
(six) and then some.&nbsp; Hence, a bid of one means the team
expects
to win six tricks plus one, or seven total.<br>
<br>
The range of bids
therefore lies from one (6 + 1 = 7 tricks total) to seven (6 + 7 = 13,
or all the tricks available).&nbsp; A contract at the 6 or 7 level
is
called a slam.&nbsp; A 6-level contract is a small slam, and a
7-level
contract is a grand slam.<br>
<br>
Each bid consists of the bid level
plus a trump suit choice.&nbsp; The trump suit is the one intended
to
be supreme for that hand.&nbsp; That is, when a card of a trump
suit is
played, it beats all cards of all other suits, plus any other trump
suit cards lower in rank (with Ace being high).&nbsp; However,
there
are specific restrictions on when you can actually play a trump card,
which will described later.&nbsp; Also, a bid can specify &#8220;no
trump&#8221;,
indicating that no suit is chosen as trump.<br>
<br>
Bridge also accords
each suit a rank.&nbsp; Spades is the highest suit, followed by
Hearts,
Diamonds, and Clubs.&nbsp; In addition, No Trump, while technically
not
a suit, ranks above Spades for bidding purposes. Therefore, a bid of
1NT is higher than 1 Spades, which is higher than 1 Hearts, and so on.<br>
<br>
The
lower ranking Club and Diamond suits are known as the minor suits,
while the higher ranking Heart and Spade suits are known as the major
suits. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The ordering of the suits is actually pretty easy
to remember since it is in alphabetical order from lowest to highest
(C-D-H-S)&nbsp; Just don&#8217;t forget that No Trump is the highest
&#8220;suit&#8221;.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting
the
Bidding.</span></h3>
<p><big>At
the beginning of the hand, the dealer begins (or opens) the
bidding.&nbsp; And as the bidding proceeds around the table, each
player must either make a bid higher than the previous one, pass, or
double the opponent&#8217;s bid.<br>
<br>
A double is actually not a bid that&#8217;s
twice as high, but rather a challenge to the opponents effectively
stating &#8220;I dare you to make that contract&#8221;.&nbsp; A doubled bid can
also be redoubled by the declaring team, meaning &#8220;Oh yeah, we sure can
make that contract.&#8221;&nbsp; Doubling and redoubling can affect the
score
as described later.<br>
<br>
During the bidding stage, the main problem
facing the players is that they can only see their own cards.&nbsp;
They cannot see the cards held by their partners, much less those of
their opponents.&nbsp; So the bidding is largely a boasting game
based
on deductive reasoning and educated guesses (and to some extent, coded
signals).<br>
<br>
After one or more bids have been made and three
players in a row pass on the opportunity to make a higher bid, the
final bid becomes the contract which the bidding team has to fulfill
during the card play stage.&nbsp; The bidding team is only awarded
points if they win at least the number of tricks claimed in their
bid.&nbsp; In fact, if they fail to win the number of tricks
promised,
the defending team is awarded penalty points. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
So at this
point, the game becomes a contest to see whether the declaring team can
win sufficient tricks and make the contract, or whether the defending
team can keep them from doing so, thereby setting (defeating) the
contract.

<h3 id="C3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes.</span></h3>
<big>If all four players pass on their first turn, the hand is
said to be passed out, and a new hand is dealt.<br>
Each time a new hand is dealt, the deal shifts to the next player
clockwise around the table.</big><br>
