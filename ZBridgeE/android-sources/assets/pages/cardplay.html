<p><big>After
the end of the bidding, the card play begins with the player to the
left of the declarer.&nbsp; The declarer is the player on the team
with
the winning bid who first bid the suit the team finally ended up
in.&nbsp; This is actually not as complicated as it might first
sound.<br>
<br>
As
an example, if a player bids 1H, and his partner 2D, and the final
contract is 3H, the first player would be the declarer, since he first
bid Hearts.&nbsp; Alternatively, if a player bids 1H, partner 2D,
and
the final contract is 5D, the second player would be the declarer,
since he first bid Diamonds, the final contract suit.<br>
<br>
The
declarer is also often called the Driver, as he will play the cards for
the partnership.&nbsp; Conversely, the Driver&#8217;s partner becomes the
Dummy, as he no longer participates in the card play stage (as
explained later).<br>
<br>
The lead player (once again, on the declarer&#8217;s
left), starts by taking a card from his hand and placing it face up on
the table.&nbsp; The play then proceeds clockwise around the table
as
each player in turn places one of his cards face up on the table.
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If
the current player holds one or more cards in the suit that was led, he
must play a card from that suit &#8211; this is called following
suit.&nbsp;
If he does not have any cards in the suit led (he is void in the suit),
he may play a card of a different suit, including a trump, if one was
declared in the contract.&nbsp; Note that this means a player has
the
option of playing a trump only when he is void in the suit that was led.<br>
<br>
After
the first player leads a card, the dummy in the declaring team places
all of his cards on the table face up, arranged by suit.&nbsp; This
makes his cards visible to his partner as well as the
opponents.&nbsp;
From this point on, the declarer plays the cards for dummy&#8217;s hand as
well as his own. Note, however, that he cannot play a card from his own
hand when it is dummy&#8217;s turn, or vice versa.<br>
<br>
After all four
players have played a card, the trick or round is awarded to the player
who played the highest card in the suit led.&nbsp; If however one
or
more trump cards have been played, the highest trump card wins the
trick. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Note that a card that does not match the suit led,
and which is also not a trump card, is never eligible to win a
trick.&nbsp; For this reason, playing a card that is not of the
suit
led and not a trump is called a discard.<br>
<br>
At the end of each
round, the player who played the winning card collects the cards from
the round and places it in front of him.&nbsp; That player then
leads
the first card of the next round.<br>
<br>
At the end of 13 rounds, the
number of tricks won by each team is added up.&nbsp; If the
declaring
side makes the number of tricks promised, they have made or fulfilled
the contract and are awarded trick points.&nbsp; If they exceed the
promised number of tricks, they are awarded bonus points in addition to
the trick points.&nbsp; If however they fail to make the promised
number of tricks, they are set one or more tricks and do not receive
their trick points; in fact, the defending team receives bonus points
for defeating the contract.<br>
