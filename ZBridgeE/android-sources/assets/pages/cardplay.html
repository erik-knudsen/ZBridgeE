<p><big>After the end of the bidding, the card play begins with the player to
the left of the declarer.  The declarer is the player on the team with the
winning bid who first bid the suit the team finally ended up in.<br>
</big></p>

<p><big>The declarers partner becomes the Dummy. The Dummy does no longer
participate in the card play stage (see later).<br>
<br>
The lead player, starts by taking a card from his hand and placing it face up
on the table.  The play then proceeds clockwise around the table as each player
in turn places one of his cards face up on the table.  <br>
<br>
If the current player holds one or more cards in the suit that was led, he must
play a card from that suit &ndash; this is called following suit.  If he does
not have any cards in the suit led, he may play a card of a different suit,
including a trump, if one was declared in the contract.  Note that this means a
player has the option of playing a trump only when he is void in the suit that
was led.<br>
<br>
After the first player leads a card, the Dummy in the declaring team places all
of his cards on the table face up, arranged by suit.  This makes his cards
visible to his partner as well as the opponents.  From this point on, the
declarer plays the cards for Dummy&rsquo;s hand as well as his own.<br>
<br>
After all four players have played a card, the trick or round is won by the
player who played the highest card in the suit led.  If however one or more
trump cards have been played, the highest trump card wins the trick.  <br>
<br>
Note that a card that does not match the suit led, and which is also not a
trump card, can not win a trick.  For this reason, playing a card that is not
of the suit led and not a trump is called a discard.<br>
<br>
At the end of each round, the player who played the winning card collects the
cards from the round and places it in front of him.  That player then leads the
first card of the next round.<br>
<br>
At the end of 13 rounds, the number of tricks won by each team is added up.  If
the declaring side makes the number of tricks promised, they have made or
fulfilled the contract and are given trick points.  If they exceed the promised
number of tricks, they are given bonus points in addition to the trick points. 
If however they fail to make the promised number of tricks, the defending team
receives bonus points for defeating the contract.<br>
