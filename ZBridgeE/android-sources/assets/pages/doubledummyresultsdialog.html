<p><big>Double dummy play is a play where all cards are
visible to all
players. Statistical studies have shown that the overall picture of
double dummy play is that actual declarer play does slightly better
than double-dummy play <i>except</i> at the slam level
where double-dummy play has a slight edge. The&nbsp;reason is
apparent: The opening lead gives the defense a considerable advantage
at double-dummy; e.g., the perfect lead will sometimes bury a contract
before declarer has a chance. As&nbsp;the contract level increases,
the opening lead tends to be less crucial, so the advantage tapers off,
disappearing entirely from 5&nbsp;NT upward.</big></p>
<p><big>Double dummy play can be solved by the computer. Bo
Haglunds double dummy solver is used to give double dummy results as
shown here.</big></p>

<p><big>The table shows the number of tricks possible using
double dummy
analysis with a given suit and side. The par contract is also shown.
<br><br>
<b>Par</b> can be defined as&nbsp;&#8220;the result on a hand
if both sides have done as well as possible.&#8221; This implicitly includes
both bidding and play. In other words, a par contract has been reached
when neither side can improve their score by bidding again.</big></p>
