<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Honour Suit With No Honour Sequence.</span>
<br>
Choose 4th best lead, 3rd best from 4 or 5-card suits and 5th
best from longer suits or low encouraging which means a low card
encourages play in the suit. Preconfigured in the  <a href="bidsys.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid convention sets (SAYC etc.).

<h3 id="C2"><b>Signals.</b></h3>
<p><big>
When following to a suit or when discarding in a suit, the relative
spot of a card is used to send signals.
Signals are usually given with cards from the Two spot to the Nine
spot.
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attitude Signal</span>
<br>
The attitude signal indicates the level of interest toward
the suit, in which the signal is given. Common practice include <b>positive</b>
and <b>negative</b>
attitude signals. A positive signal can be either a relative high card
or a relative low card. And a negative signal the opposite. Preconfigured in <a href="bidsys.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid convention sets (SAYC etc.).
<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="right" valign="top">1.</td>
<td valign="top">A positive signal shows
positive attitude toward the suit being led.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right" valign="top">2.</td>
<td valign="top">A negative signal shows
negative attitude toward the suit being led.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Count Signal
</span><br>
The count signal is used to show the number of cards held in a
suit being
led. Common practice include <b>even</b> and <b>uneven</b> signals. An even signal
can either be a relative high card or a relative low card. And an
uneven signal the opposite. Preconfigured in <a href="bidsys.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid convention sets (SAYC etc.).
<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="right" valign="top">1.</td>
<td valign="top">An even signal shows an even
number of cards in a suit being led.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right" valign="top">2.</td>
<td valign="top">An uneven signal shows an odd
number of cards in a suit being led.</td>
</tr>
