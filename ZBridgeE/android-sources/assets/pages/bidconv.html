<h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 204);">Bidding Conventions.</span></h1>

<p><big>ZBridge supports the following bidding conventions:</big></p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="C1">Four-Card and Five-Card Majors.</h3>

<p><big>When playing Four-Card majors, any four-card suit can be opened.  When
playing Five-Card majors, a major suit can only be opend if it has five or more
cards.  If you don't have any 5-card major suits, a 3-card minor can be opened
instead. See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">General</span></a> in </big><big>the Bid and Play
Configuration dialog.</big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C2">Strong 2-Bids.</h3>

<p><big>Strong 2 Bids normally indicate 22+ points in the hand. </big><big>See
<a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">General</span></a> in the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog. </big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C3">Weak 2-Bids.</h3>

<p><big>Weak 2 Bids are used to open hands that have a good long suit but do
not have the strength to open at the 1 level.  Normally the hand will have a
6-card major with 2+ honors, a short side suit, and 6-11 points.<br>
A response of 2NT to an opening weak 2 is forcing and is conventional and could
be either Ogust or Feature. See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Generals</span></a> in the Bid and Play
Configuration dialog. </big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C4">Artificial 2 Club Opening.</h3>

<p><big>The Artificial 2 club opening shows a strong hand of 22+ points. This
is a forcing bid; partner must respond positively with his best suit at the
cheapest level if slam is a possibility, or negatively with 2D if slam is
unlikely.<br>
If partner responds negatively with 2D, opener should bid his best suit. 
Partner can then pass or show his own best suit if below game.  It is then up
to opener to return to his suit or support partner's suit. </big><big>See <a
href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">General</span></a> in the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog. </big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C5">Weak Jump Overcalls.</h3>

<p><big>A Jump Overcall is a bid made over an opponent at a level one higher
than necessary (e.g., an overcall of 2S instead of 1S over an opponent&rsquo;s
1H opening).  Normally such an overcall of an opponent's bid at the 2-level
shows a strong hand with 15-18 points.  When playing Weak Jump Overcalls,
however, the bid shows a hand similar to a weak 2 opening -- i.e., 6-11 points
and a 6+ card suit. <br>
A response of 2NT to a Weak Jump Overcall can be forcing and conventional and
could be either Ogust or Feature if it is not natural (preconfigured in <a
href="bidsys.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid
convention sets (SAYC etc.).). See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C6"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Misc</span> </a>in the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog. <br>
Note that an overcall at the 3-level or higher is not a jump overcall but a
preemptive bid. </big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C6">Stayman Convention.</h3>

<p><big>The Stayman convention is the bid of 2 Clubs in response to partners
1NT opening.  The bid asks partner whether he has a 4-card major suit.  If the
opener has a 4+ card suit in either Hearts or Spades, he should respond with 2H
or 2S, accordingly.  If he has 4 cards in both Hearts and Spades, he should
respond in Hearts.  And if he lacks a 4-card major, he should respond
negatively with 2D.<br>
Stayman can also be used in response to 2NT openings by bidding 3 Clubs; the
responses by opener are then at the 3-level.  See <a
href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">General</span> </a>in the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog. </big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C7">Jacoby Transfers.</h3>

<p><big>The Jacoby Transfer convention is used in response to an opening bid of
1NT.  It directs the opener to make a bid in the next higher suit.  Normally,
the responder will have a 5-card suit.<br>
For instance, opposite partner&rsquo;s 1NT opening you might hold five Hearts. 
You know that partner has at least two hearts (with a balanced hand), so you
want to play in hearts.  But since partner has the stronger hand, you want him
to be the declarer.  <br>
You therefore make a Jacoby Transfer bid at 2 Diamonds, which instructs partner
to bid the next higher suit, or 2 Hearts.  If partner really likes hearts, he
can instead bid 3H. See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">General</span></a> in the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog.</big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C8">Four-Suit Transfers (aka Jacoby Transfers to Minors).</h3>

<p><big>Normally, Jacoby transfers only allow the responder to specify a
transfer to Hearts, Spades, or Clubs using bids of 2D through 2S,
respectively.  A bid of 2C is reserved for Stayman, and 2NT is a natural
raise.<br>
If Four-Suit Transfers are enabled, the bid of 2NT becomes a fourth shift bid,
indicating that opener should bid Diamonds. </big><big>Preconfigured in <a
href="bidsys.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid
convention sets (SAYC etc.).</big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C9">Limit Raises.</h3>

<p><big>In the US, a single raise of a suit from the one level to the two level
shows 6 to 9 points, and a double raise to the three level shows 13-18 points. 
This leaves a gap if responder holds 11 to 12 points.  Normally in this case an
alternate suit is bid by responder, leaving the opener uncertain about
partner&rsquo;s holdings.<br>
Limit raises address this problem by changing the meaning of a double raise to
a holding of 10-12 points with four card support.  Of course, this raises the
question of what to do with 13+ pts and good support when playing limit raises
&ndash; and the usual answer is to shift to another suit. </big><big>See <a
href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">General</span> </a>in the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog. </big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C10">Takeout Doubles.</h3>

<p><big>A takeout is a double called at a bidder&rsquo;s first opportunity
after the opposition makes a bid.  It shows that the bidder has opening values
with at least supporting strength (normally 3+ cards) in all unbid suits.  For
instance, examine the following sequence: <br>
</big></p>

<div style="margin-left: 60px;">

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100px;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">North</td>
      <td align="center">East</td>
      <td align="center">South</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">Pass</td>
      <td align="center">1C</td>
      <td align="center">Double</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<big><br>
The above double shows that South holds at least 12 points along with three or
more cards in each of Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades.  This is a forcing bid, and
partner is required to respond in his best suit of the three.  However, if the
other opponent (West in this case) makes an intervening bid, the takeout is no
longer forcing, and partner (North) can pass with a weak hand.  Also, in rare
cases partner may pass and convert the takeout into a penalty double with
length in the opponents&rsquo; suit.<br>
Doubles over 1 and 2-level opening bids are always for takeout. Doubles over
4-level are always for penalty. </big><big>See <a
href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Misc</span>
</a>in the Bid and Play Configuration dialog. </big> 

<p><big></big><br>
</p>

<h3 id="C11">Negative Doubles.</h3>

<p><big>Negative Doubles are similar to takeout doubles in that they show
strength in the unbid majors.  Negative doubles, however, are made by responder
after partner has opened the bidding and the right-hand opponent has
overcalled.  For example, examine the following sequence. <br>
</big> </p>

<div style="margin-left: 60px;">

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100px;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center;"><big>North</big></th>
      <th style="text-align: center;"><big>East</big></th>
      <th style="text-align: center;"><big>South</big></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;"><big>1C</big></td>
      <td style="text-align: center;"><big>1D</big></td>
      <td style="text-align: center;"><big>Double</big></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<big><br>
<br>
The above double shows that South has good holdings in each of Hearts and
Spades, but does not like Clubs.  He may or may not have good holdings in
Diamonds.<br>
Negative doubles can be made on overcalls up to 2S.  A negative double made on
a 1-level overcall shows 4+ cards in the unbid majors and 6+ points.  A
negative double made on a 2-level overcall shows 5+ cards in the unbid majors
and 11+ points. </big><big>See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C6"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Misc</span> </a>in the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog. </big> 

<p><big></big><br>
</p>

<h3 id="C12">Unusual No Trump.</h3>

<p><big>The Unusual No Trump bid is an overcall of 2NT over an opponent's
1-level opening bid.  It shows at least 5 cards in each of the two lowest unbid
suits. <br>
<br>
Examples of Unusual NT Bids and their meanings: <br>
</big> </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<table style="text-align: left; width: 501px; height: 251px;" border="1"
cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

        Diamonds </big></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<big><br>
The convention is normally used with either a weak hand with 6-11 pts, or a
strong hand with 17+ pts.  When an intermediate hand of 12-16 pts is held, a
simple overcall or takeout double is preferred.<br>
Partner should always assume that partner made the Unusual NT bid with the
weaker type of hand.  He should pick one of the suits and respond at the 3
level if game does not appear likely.  Alternatively, He can raise to game if
it appears attainable.  A cue bid of the enemy suit can also be used to invite
slam.  See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C6"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Misc</span> </a>in the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog.</big><br>


<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="C13">Michaels Cue Bids.</h3>

<p><big>The Michaels Cue bid is related to the Unusual No Trump bid.  It is the
direct 2-level overcall of an opening 1-level suit bid by the immediately
previous opponent (RHO), and indicates a 2-suited hand.  When overcalling a
minor suit, it indicates 5/5 shape in the majors, or exceptionally, 5 in one
major and a strong 4 in the other.  When overcalling a major, it indicates 5/5
in the other major and an unspecified minor.<br>
<br>

<big><br>
<br>
As with the Unusual No Trump bid, the convention is normally used with either a
weak hand with 6-11 pts, or a strong hand with 17+ pts.  When an intermediate
hand of 12-16 pts is held, a simple overcall or takeout double is preferred.<br>
It is up to the responder to pick a suit from among the two 5-card majors or
inquire about the minor.<br>
When the two suits are known (i.e., the two majors), partner is free to bid one
of the suits.  A response at the 2 level is not forcing; a response at the 3
level is invitational, and at the 4-level is a preemptive shutout bid or
sacrifice. </big><big>See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C6"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Misc</span> </a>in the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog.</big><br>


<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="C14">Jacoby 2NT.</h3>

<p><big>A Jacoby 2NT is the response of 2NT to an opening 1-level major suit
bid by partner.  It shows 12+ points, good trump support, and is forcing to
game.<br>
In response to the Jacoby 2NT bid, opener must indicate his strength by making
one of the following bids: <br>
</big> </p>

Partner can then either sign off in game, or push on towards
slam. </big><big>Preconfigured in <a href="bidsys.html"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid convention sets (SAYC
etc.).</big><br>


<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="C15">Gambling 3NT (Standard and ACOL).</h3>

<p><big>The Gambling 3NT is an opening bid of 3NT.  It is usually made with a
long, solid minor and little outside strength.<br>
<br>
The standard version of the Gambling 3NT is made with a solid 7+ card minor
suit, 10-12 HCPs, no voids or small singletons, and no outside stoppers.  If
partner has stoppers in at least three suits and no void minors, he can pass. 
Otherwise, he should bid 4 Clubs, which opener can correct to 4 Diamonds if
necessary.<br>
<br>
The ACOL version is much less of a gambling bid.  It is also made with a 7+
card solid minor, no void or small singleton, but with 16-21 HCPs and stoppers
in 2 or (usually) 3 outside suits.  In this version, partner should always pass
unless he has interest in slam. <br>

style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid convention sets (SAYC etc.).
</big></p>
<br>


<h3 id="C16">Fourth Suit Forcing.</h3>

<p><big>Normally when a partnership goes through four suits, there is little
chance that the pair will agree on the fourth suit as trump.  For this reason,
some players prefer to use the bid of a fourth suit as artificial and forcing
in order to keep the bidding going. Preconfigured in <a

convention sets (SAYC etc.).</big></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="C17">Blackwood Convention.</h3>

<p><big>The Blackwood convention is used to test for Aces and Kings in
preparation for a possible slam.<br>
<br>
A bid of 4NT, when not in direct response to a NT bid from partner, is an
inquiry of how many Aces partner has.  Partner must respond as shown next to
show his holdings of Aces: <br>

</div>
<big><br>
<br>
If partner responds 5 Club, the player should know from the context (and his
own hand) whether partner means zero or all four Aces.<br>
<br>
At this point, the player can either bail out at a 5-level contract, if
possible, or bid slam, or continue to query partner for more information.  A
second round of Blackwood can be used by bidding 5NT, asking for Kings.  The
responses from partner parallel the earlier structure: </big>

<p></p>

<div style="margin-left: 60px;">

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100px;" border="1" cellpadding="2"

      <td align="center"><big>Three Kings</big></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<big><br>
<br>
Since bidding 5NT forces the partnership to commit to a slam, it is generally
not done unless the partnership holds all four Aces.  At this point, the bidder
can use his best judgment to decide whether to play a small slam or a grand
slam, and in what suit. Preconfigured in <a href="bidsys.html"><span

<h3 id="C18">Gerber Convention.</h3>

<p><big>The Gerber convention is used to test for Aces and Kings in preparation
for a possible slam after a NT bid.<br>
<br>
Over a natural bid of 1NT or 2NT, a response of 4 Club is a Gerber bid asking
for Aces.  Partner must respond as shown next to show his holdings of Aces: <br>

<h3 id="C19">Control Bids.</h3>

<p><big>Control Bids are used as a safer alternative to Blackwood to check for
slam possibility.  A control bid is a bid of an alternate suit at the 3-level
or higher after a trump suit has been agreed upon. It indicates that the bidder
holds an Ace in that suit, and asks partner to name the next-cheapest suit that
he holds an ace in.  The responder can then signal encouragement by showing the
ace, or discourage slam interest by returning to the contract suit.  </big></p>

<h3 id="C20">Splinter Bids.</h3>

<p><big>A Splinter is a double jump shift in response to a 1-level opening bid
by partner.  It shows the points for a double raise, plus a singleton or void
in the suit shifted to.  It shows strong interest in slam.  Preconfigured in <a

<h3 id="C21">No Trump Opening Ranges.</h3>

<p><big>Most players use a Strong 1 No Trump, signifying a balanced hand with
either 15-17 or 16-18 High Card points.  Some players also use a Weak No Trump,
often 12-14 points.<br>
<br>
Likewise, people don&rsquo;t always agree on the appropriate point counts for
an opening of 2NT or 3NT.  In fact, some people don&rsquo;t like to open 3NT at
all, instead preferring the general purpose 2 strong 2 Club opening.  A 3NT
opening is also often reserved for the Gambling 3NT convention.  See <a

dialog. </big></p>

<h3 id="C22">Reverse Restrictions.</h3>

<p><big>A Reverse is a shift to a higher ranking suit by opener at the
two-level after previously opening at the one-level.  It is commonly accepted
that a player making a reverse must have at least 16 points. </big></p>
