<h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 204);">Bidding
Conventions.</span></h1>
<p><big>
Bidding conventions supported by ZBridge are the following.</big></p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="C1">Four-Card and Five-Card Majors.</h3>
<p><big>
When playing Four-Card majors, any four-card suit can be
opened.&nbsp; When playing Five-Card majors, you can only open a
major suit if it has five or more cards.&nbsp; If you don't have
any 5-card major suits, a 3-card minor can be opened instead.
See&nbsp;<a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span></a>
in&nbsp;</big><big>the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog.</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C2">Strong 2-Bids.</h3>
<p><big>
Strong 2 Bids generally indicate 20+ points in the hand.&nbsp; A
strong 2 Club bid indicates the strongest hand of all, with a minimum
ranging from 20 to 23 points (but usually 22). </big><big>See
<a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span></a> in
the Bid and Play
Configuration
dialog.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C3">Weak 2-Bids.</h3>
<p><big>
Weak 2 Bids are used to open hands that have a good long suit but
otherwise lack the strength to open at the 1 level.&nbsp; Generally
the hand will have a 6-card major with 2+ honors, a short side suit,
and 6-11 points.<br>
A response of 2NT to an opening weak 2 is forcing and is conventional
and could be either Ogust or Feature. See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Generals</span></a> in
the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C4">Artificial 2 Club Opening.</h3>
<p><big>
The Artificial 2 club opening indicates a strong hand of about 22+
points. This is a forcing bid; partner must respond positively with his
best suit at the cheapest level if slam is a possibility, or negatively
at 2D if slam is unlikely.<br>
If partner responds negatively at 2D, opener should bid his best
suit.&nbsp; Partner can then pass or indicate his own best suit if
below game.&nbsp; It is then up to Opener's discretion to return to
his suit or support partner's suit.&nbsp;</big><big>
See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span></a>
in the Bid and Play
Configuration
dialog.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C5">Weak Jump Overcalls.</h3>
<p><big>
A Jump Overcall is a bid made over an opponent at a level one higher
than necessary (e.g., an overcall of 2S instead of 1S over an
opponent&#8217;s 1H opening).&nbsp; Normally such an overcall of an
opponent's bid at the 2-level indicates a strong hand with 15-18
points.&nbsp; When playing Weak Jump Overcalls, however, the bid
indicates a hand similar to a weak 2 opening -- i.e., 6-11 points and a
6+ card suit. <br>
A response of 2NT to a Weak Jump Overcall can be forcing and
conventional
and could be either Ogust or Feature if it is not natural (preconfigured in <a href="bidsys.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid convention sets (SAYC etc.).). See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Misc</span> </a>in
the Bid and Play Configuration
dialog.
<br>
Note that an overcall at the 3-level or higher is not a
jump overcall but rather a preemptive bid.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C6">Stayman Convention.</h3>
<p><big>
The Stayman convention is the bid of 2 Clubs in response to partner&#8217;s
1NT opening.&nbsp; The bid asks partner whether he has a 4-card
major suit.&nbsp; If the opener has a 4+ card suit in either Hearts
or Spades, he should respond with 2H or 2S, accordingly.&nbsp; If
he has 4 cards in both Hearts and Spades, he should respond in
Hearts.&nbsp; And if he lacks a 4-card major, he should respond
negatively with 2D.<br>
Stayman can also be used in response to 2NT openings by bidding 3
Clubs; the responses by opener are then at the 3-level.&nbsp;
See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span>
</a>in the Bid and Play
Configuration
dialog.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C7">Jacoby Transfers.</h3>
<p><big>
The Jacoby Transfer convention is used in response to an opening bid of
1NT.&nbsp; It directs the opener to make a bid in the next higher
suit.&nbsp; Generally, the responder will have a 5-card suit.<br>
For instance, opposite partner&#8217;s 1NT opening you might hold five
Hearts.&nbsp; You know that partner has at least two hearts (with a
balanced hand), so you want to play in hearts.&nbsp; But since
partner has the stronger hand, you want him to be the
declarer.&nbsp; This is because it has been shown that playing the
contract with the stronger hand hidden can provide one extra trick on
average. <br>
You therefore make a Jacoby Transfer bid at 2 Diamonds, which instructs
partner to bid the next higher suit, or 2 Hearts.&nbsp; If partner
really likes hearts, he can instead bid 3H.
See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span></a>
in the Bid and Play
Configuration
dialog.</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C8">Four-Suit Transfers (aka Jacoby Transfers to
Minors).</h3>
<p><big>
Normally, Jacoby transfers only allow the responder to specify a
transfer to Hearts, Spades, or Clubs using bids of 2D through 2S,
respectively.&nbsp; A bid of 2C is reserved for Stayman, and 2NT is
a natural raise.<br>
If Four-Suit Transfers are enabled, the bid of 2NT becomes a fourth
shift bid, indicating that opener should bid Diamonds.&nbsp;</big><big>
Preconfigured in <a href="bidsys.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid convention sets (SAYC etc.).</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C9">Limit Raises.</h3>
<p><big>
In the US, a single raise of a suit from the one level to the two level
indicates 6 to 9 points, and a double raise to the three level
indicates 13-18 points.&nbsp; This leaves a gap if responder holds
11 to 12 points.&nbsp; Normally in this case an alternate suit is
bid by responder, leaving the opener uncertain about partner&#8217;s holdings.<br>
Limit raises address this problem by changing the meaning of a double
raise to a holding of 10-12 points with four card support.&nbsp; Of
course, this raises the question of what to do with 13+ pts and good
support when playing limit raises &#8211; and the usual answer is to shift to
another suit.&nbsp;</big><big>
See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span>
</a>in the Bid and Play
Configuration
dialog.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C10">Takeout Doubles.</h3>
<p><big>
A takeout is a double called at a bidder&#8217;s first opportunity after the
opposition makes a bid.&nbsp; It indicates that the bidder has
opening values with at least supporting strength (generally 3+ cards)
in all unbid suits.&nbsp; For instance, examine the following
sequence:
<br>
</big></p>
<div style="margin-left: 60px;">
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">North</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">East</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">South</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">Pass</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">1C</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">Double</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<big><br>
<br>
The above double indicates that South holds at
least 12 points along
with three or more cards in each of Diamonds, Hearts, and
Spades.&nbsp; This is a forcing bid, and partner is required to
respond in his best suit of the three.&nbsp; However, if the other
opponent (West in this case) makes an intervening bid, the takeout is
no longer forcing, and partner (North) can pass with a weak
hand.&nbsp; Also, in rare cases partner may pass and convert the
takeout into a penalty double with length in the opponents&#8217; suit.<br>
Doubles&nbsp;over 1 and 2-level opening bids are always for
takeout. Doubles over 4-level are always for penalty.&nbsp;</big><big>
See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Misc</span> </a>in
the Bid and Play
Configuration
dialog.
</big><br>
<h3 id="C11">Negative Doubles.</h3>
<p><big>
Negative Doubles are similar to takeout doubles in that they indicate
strength in the unbid majors.&nbsp; Negative doubles, however, are
made by responder after partner has opened the bidding and the
right-hand opponent has overcalled.&nbsp; For example, examine the
following sequence.
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 60px;">
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">North</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">East</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">South</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1C</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1D</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Double</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<br>
<br>
The above double indicates that South has good holdings in each of
Hearts and Spades, but does not like Clubs.&nbsp; She may or may
not have good holdings in Diamonds.<br>
Negative doubles can be made on overcalls of up to 2S.&nbsp; A
negative double made on a 1-level overcall indicates 4+ cards in the
unbid majors and 6+ points.&nbsp; A negative double made on a
2-level overcall indicates 5+ cards in the unbid majors and 11+
points.&nbsp;</big><big>
See <a href="bidandplaydialogs.html#C6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Misc</span> </a>in
the Bid and Play
Configuration
dialog.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C12">Unusual No Trump.</h3>
<p><big>
The Unusual No Trump bid is an overcall of 2NT over an opponent's
1-level opening bid.&nbsp; It indicates at least 5 cards in each of
the two lowest unbid suits.
<br>
<br>
Examples of Unusual NT Bids and their meanings:
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<table style="text-align: left; width: 501px; height: 251px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

<td style="text-align: center;">Again,

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<br>
<br>
The convention is normally used with either a weak hand with 6-11 pts,
or a strong hand with 17+ pts.&nbsp; When an intermediate hand of
12-16 pts is held, a simple overcall or takeout double is preferred.<br>
Partner should always assume that partner made the Unusual NT bid with
the weaker type of hand.&nbsp; He should pick one of the suits and
respond at the 3 level if game does not appear likely.&nbsp;
Alternatively, He can raise to game if it appears
attainable.&nbsp; A cue bid of the enemy suit can also be used to
invite slam.&nbsp;

the Bid and Play
Configuration
dialog.</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C13">Michaels Cue Bids.</h3>
<p><big>
The Michaels Cue bid is related to the Unusual No Trump bid.&nbsp;
It is the direct 2-level overcall of an opening 1-level suit bid by the
immediately previous opponent (RHO), and indicates a 2-suited
hand.&nbsp; When overcalling a minor suit, it indicates 5/5 shape
in the majors, or exceptionally, 5 in one major and a strong 4 in the
other.&nbsp; When overcalling a major, it indicates 5/5 in the
other major and an unspecified minor.<br>
<br>
Examples of Michaels Bids and their meanings:
<br>

<td style="text-align: center;">3D</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Not Michaels; the
overcall needs to be at the 2-level.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<br>
<br>
As with the Unusual No Trump bid, the convention is normally used with
either a weak hand with 6-11 pts, or a strong hand with 17+
pts.&nbsp; When an intermediate hand of 12-16 pts is held, a simple
overcall or takeout double is preferred.<br>
It is up to the responder to pick a suit from among the two 5-card
majors or inquire about the minor.<br>
When the two suits are known (i.e., the two majors), partner is free to
bid one of the suits.&nbsp; A response at the 2 level is not
forcing; a response at the 3 level is invitational, and at the 4-level
is a preemptive shutout bid or sacrifice.&nbsp;</big><big>

the Bid and Play

<br>
<h3 id="C14">Jacoby 2NT.</h3>
<p><big>
A Jacoby 2NT is the response of 2NT to an opening 1-level major suit
bid by partner.&nbsp; It shows 12+ points, good trump support, and
is forcing to game.<br>
In response to the Jacoby 2NT bid, opener must indicate his strength by
making one of the following bids:
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<br>
Partner can then either sign off in game, or push on towards
slam.&nbsp;</big><big>Preconfigured in <a href="bidsys.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid convention sets (SAYC etc.).</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C15">Gambling 3NT (Standard and ACOL).</h3>
<p><big>
The Gambling 3NT is an opening bid of 3NT.&nbsp; It is usually made
with a long, solid minor and little outside strength.<br>
<br>
The standard version of the Gambling 3NT is made with a solid 7+ card
minor suit, 10-12 HCPs, no voids or small singletons, and no outside
stoppers.&nbsp; If partner has stoppers in at least three suits and
no void minors, she can pass.&nbsp; Otherwise, she should bid 4
Clubs, which opener can correct to 4 Diamonds if necessary.<br>
<br>
The ACOL version is much less of a gambling bid.&nbsp; It is also
made with a 7+ card solid minor, no void or small singleton, but with
16-21 HCPs and stoppers in 2 or (usually) 3 outside suits.&nbsp; In
this version, partner should always pass unless she has interest in
slam.

</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C16">Fourth Suit Forcing.</h3>
<p><big>
Normally when a partnership goes through four suits, there is little
chance that the pair will agree on the fourth suit as trump.&nbsp;
For this reason, some players prefer to use the bid of a fourth suit as
artificial and forcing in order to keep the bidding going.
Preconfigured in <a href="bidsys.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">standard</span></a> bid convention sets (SAYC etc.).</big></p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="C17">Blackwood Convention.</h3>
<p><big>
The Blackwood convention is used to test for Aces and Kings in
preparation for a possible slam.<br>
<br>
A bid of 4NT, when not in direct response to an NT bid from partner, is
an inquiry of how many Aces partner has.&nbsp; Partner is obligated
to respond using the following codes to indicate his holdings of Aces:
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 60px;">
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">5 Club</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">Zero or all four Aces</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">5 Diamond</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">One Ace</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">5 Heart</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined"> Two Aces</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">5 Spade</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">Three Aces</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<br>
<br>
If partner responds 5 Club, the player should know from the context
(and his own hand) whether partner means zero or all four Aces.<br>
<br>
At this point, the player can either bail out at a 5-level contract, if
possible, or bid slam, or continue to query partner for more
information.&nbsp; A second round of Blackwood can be used by
bidding 5NT, asking for Kings.&nbsp; The responses from partner
parallel the earlier structure:
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 60px;">
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">6 Club</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">Zero or all four Kings</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">6 Diamond</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">One King</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">6 Heart</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">Two Kings</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">6 Spade</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">Three Kings</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<br>
<br>
Since bidding 5NT forces the partnership to commit to a slam, it is
generally not done unless the partnership holds all four
Aces.&nbsp; At this point, the bidder can use his best judgment to
decide whether to play a small slam or a grand slam, and in what suit.

</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C18">Gerber Convention.</h3>
<p><big>
The Gerber convention is used to test for Aces and Kings in preparation
for a possible slam after an NT bid.<br>
<br>
Over a natural bid of 1NT or 2NT, a response of 4 Club is a Gerber bid
asking for Aces.&nbsp; Partner must respond using the following
codes to indicate his holdings of Aces:
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 60px;">
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">4 Diamond</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">Zero or all four Aces</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">4 Hearts</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">One Ace</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">4 Spade</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">Two Aces</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">4 Notrump</td>
<td align="center" nowrap="nowrap" valign="undefined">Three Aces</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<br>
<br>
If partner responds 4 Diamond, the player should know from the context
(and his own hand) whether partner means zero or all four Aces.<br>
<br>
At this point, the player can either bail out at a 5-level contract, if
possible, or bid slam, or continue to query partner for more
information.&nbsp; A second round of Gerber can be used by bidding
5 Club, asking for Kings.&nbsp; The responses from partner parallel
the earlier structure:
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 60px;">
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

If the player that instigated Gerber bids anything other than 5C in the
second pass, it is strictly to play.

<br>
<h3 id="C19">Control Bids.</h3>
<p><big>
Control Bids are used as a safer alternative to Blackwood to check for
slam
prospects.&nbsp; A control bid is a bid of an alternate suit at the
3-level or higher after a trump suit has been agreed upon. It indicates
that the bidder holds an Ace in that suit, and asks partner to name the
next-cheapest suit that she holds an ace in.&nbsp; The responder
can then signal encouragement by showing the ace, or discourage slam
interest by returning to the contract suit.&nbsp;
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C20">Splinter Bids.</h3>
<p><big>
A Splinter is a double jump shift in response to a 1-level opening bid
by partner.&nbsp; It indicates the points for a double raise, plus
a singleton or void in the suit shifted to.&nbsp; It indicates
strong interest in slam.&nbsp;

<br>
<h3 id="C21">No Trump Opening Ranges.</h3>
<p><big>
Most players use a Strong 1 No Trump, signifying a balanced hand with
either 15-17 or 16-18 High Card points.&nbsp; Some players also use
a Weak No Trump, often 12-14 points.<br>
<br>
Likewise, people don&#8217;t always agree on the appropriate point counts for
an opening of 2NT or 3NT.&nbsp; In fact, some people don&#8217;t like to
open 3NT at all, instead preferring the general purpose 2 strong 2 Club
opening.&nbsp; A 3NT opening is also often reserved for the
Gambling 3NT convention.&nbsp;

</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C22">Reverse Restrictions.</h3>
<p><big>
A Reverse is a shift to a higher ranking suit by opener at the
two-level after previously opening at the one-level.&nbsp; It is
commonly accepted that a player making a reverse must have at least 16
points.
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C23">3 Suit Responses to 1NT Opening.</h3>
<p><big><span style="font-style: italic;">There
are three options for 3C and 3D responses to 1NT opening bids.
</span><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Slam Try</b><br>
3C/3D hows a good 5-card or longer suit, and promises slam
interest.</li>
<li><b>Game Invitation</b><br>
3C/3D shows a good 6-card or longer suit, and is invitational to 3NT.</li>
<li><b>Preemptive</b><br>
3C/3D shows a 6-card or longer suit and a weak hand.</li>
