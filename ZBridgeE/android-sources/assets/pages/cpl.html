<p><big><span lang="EN-US">The computer is a
fair
player. The computer player is not as skillful as expert bridge
players, but much better than novice players. A computer player bids
naturally, plays cleverly and alerts correctly just like an
experienced player.</span>

<h3 id="C1"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Bidding
Rule Tables.</b></span></h3>
<p><big><span lang="EN-US">Bid algorithms are
based on
Bidding Rule Tables. After the bid goes
through the Bidding Rule Tables, the computer bids according to a
built-in approach. The Bidding Rule Tables characterize the bidding
system: five-card majors, weak twos, Jacoby transfers,
etc.&nbsp;ZBridge allows you to choose among many bidding options.</span>

<br>
<h3 id="C2"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Random generated hands.</span></span></h3>
<p><big><span lang="EN-US">Play
algorithms are based on random generated hands. The computer randomly
generates unknown hands under known conditions that are derived from
information of the auction (HCP range, suit length, number of Aces).
The computer regards the generated hands just as real hands and decides
possible best plays using double dummy algorithms. Afterwards it
chooses among these best plays using&nbsp;
information based on the defenders' signals.
The computer iterates hand generation and
makes decisions about the&nbsp;play. It evaluates the set of
decisions derived from each simulation trial, and then makes the
final&nbsp;play.</span></big></p>

<h2 id="C3"><span lang="EN-US"><b><font style="font-size: 15pt;" color="#0000cc">Built-In
Approach of ZBridge Bidding.</font></b></span></h2>
<p class="a1"><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
<p><big><span lang="EN-US">ZBridge
uses the Bidding
Rule Tables at the early stage of the auction. After the bid goes
through the Bidding Rule Tables, the computer will bid according to the
built-in approach. Built-in approaches are as follows.</span>
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C4"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Non-Forcing
and Limit.</b></span></h3>
<p><big><span lang="EN-US">New suit
bids and rebids are
usually non-forcing. Notrump bids and raises of partner's suit are
limit bids.</span>
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C5"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Cue
Bids.</b></span></h3>
<p><big><span lang="EN-US">Guarantees
added strength to
bid an opponent's suit or to bid a new suit after a trump fit is found,
but does not guarantee any length of the bid suit.</span>
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C6"><b><span lang="EN-US">Exception.</span></b></h3>
<p><big><span lang="EN-US">After a
minor suit fit has
been found, a new suit bid of three normally shows stoppers in the bid
suit.</span>
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C7"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Doubles.</b></span></h3>
<p><big><span lang="EN-US">When the
partner shows some
strength, all doubles are for penalties. Otherwise, doubles against
three or lower bids are for takeout and doubles against four or higher
bids are for penalties.</span>
</big></p>
<br>
<h3 id="C8"><span lang="EN-US"><b>Ace
Asking Bids.</b></span></h3>
<p><big><span lang="EN-US">4NT is
usually a Blackwood
convention. 4C after 1NT or 2NT opening bids is Gerber
convention.

<h2 id="C9"><font style="font-size: 15pt;" color="#0000cc"><b><span lang="EN-US">Hand
Valuation of ZBridge.</span></b></font></h2>
<p class="a1"><font style="font-size: 15pt;" color="#0000cc"><b><span lang="EN-US"></span></b></font></p>
<p><big><span lang="EN-US">ZBridge
supports various
types of natural bidding systems. These systems are based on the common
hand valuation and approach below.</span>
<br>
<br>
<b>High Card Points (HCP)</b><br>
Ace=4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King=3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Queen=2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack=1
<br>
<br>
<b>Distribution Points (DP) when a trump fit is found</b><br>
1 point for each doubleton<br>
2 points for each singleton<br>
3 points for each void
<br>
<br>
<b>Long Suit Points (LP)</b><br>
At its simplest it is considered that long suits have a value
beyond the HCP held. This can be turned into numbers by adding one
point
for each card exceeding 4 cards in a suit.
<br>
<br>
<b>Trump Fit Points (FP)</b><br>
Add 1 point for each trump over 8-card fitting.
<br>
<br>
<b>Total Points (TP)</b><br>
When intending to make a bid in a suit and there is not
agreement on trump suit, add high card points (HCP) and long suit
points
(LP) to get
the total point value of one's hand. When intending to raise an agreed
trump suit, add high card points (HCP) and distribution points (DP) and
trump fit points (FP). When making a
bid in notrump with intent to play, value high card points (HCP) only.
<br>
<br>
<b>Control Number</b><br>
Ace=2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King=1

<b>Note:</b>
<br>
ZBridge
jumps to a new suit with 16 or more points after the partner opens with
one in a suit. This means that a jump shift is a slam invitation and is
not a slam forcing.
