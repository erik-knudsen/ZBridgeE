 * @brief Bid and play handling.
 *
 * The class handles bid and play for one actor i.e. each actor has a bid and play object.
 *  - It generates initally engines for automatic bidding and for automatic playing, and uses these engines
 *    for bidding and playing.
 *  - It stores the bid history and the play history.
 *  - It also has the actors cards and the dummys cards.
 *  - It determines the next leader after a trick has been played.
 *  - It supports undo of bid and undo of play.
